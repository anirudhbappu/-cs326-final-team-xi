Idea: The idea is to make a website which has multiplayer games and through this you can make friends with people who want to play the same game. So you can make friends with people
      who want to play the same game. This is benefial for people who cannot make or don't have many friends. This can be related to other multiplayer games like Fornite but this 
      would offer some other games.
      
Important Components: The components would be that each user would get his/her own userid through which they can make their own posts. They can also like the others post or comment
                      on others post so that they can also play with other people. There would be a link to either go to the game or download the game on the website so that the users
                      can play with other users of the website
