Idea: We will build a website where UMass students can look up for the most popular online multiplayer games played by students at UMass, and also share his/her in-game user_id with gamers who play the same game. It will be a great way to make new friends as well, especially for people who have always wanted to find a way to search for people in UMass who also play the same games as them. Students who regularly play games can upvote the games available, or add new ones themselves, and that way we can track and display which games are the most popular in our campus. For people who don't usually play games that often, this website can provide a platform to socialize as they will be able to pick up one of the more popular games being displayed on the website and start playing to make new friends. The games themselves will not be hosted on the website, but a download link or a link to their official websites will be included with each game. Each game will have one post/poll, and people will be able to communicate in the comment section below each of them.

Our application is not realted to any existing application thaat I know of.
      
Important Components: 1) there will be one post/poll for each game
                      2) people will be able to communicate in the comment section below each post/poll
                      3) The games themselves will not be hosted on the website, but a download link or a link to their official websites will be included with each game
                      4) people can upvote the games they play, or add new ones that have not been added yet. This way we can rank which games are the most popular in campus
                      5) We will let people create their accounts (with umass email probably, if thats acceptable)
